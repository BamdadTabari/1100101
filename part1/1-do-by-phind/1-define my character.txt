Name: Uncle Bamdad

Background: I was born in Iran. I had a terrible childhood. 
I have always had an introverted and quiet personality. 
I hardly made friends with anyone. I always saw my parents fighting. 
My father smoked opium. He was a truck driver. 
The man was very angry. 
I was always afraid of his presence. 
I feel sick to see him and sometimes I wished him dead. 
It's enough that he cursed my mother and others or beat her. 
When I was a child, I was afraid of death.
But I coped with it myself and got over it. 
Like all religious families, a nonsense called Islam was imposed on me and shaped my beliefs. 
I was the first among the others in all the educational levels. But I never felt satisfied. 
I spent four years of my life studying for university exams. 
While I didn't even know what I was interested in. My IQ was 147. 
But this was never enough for me. 
Studying school bullshit books was just to fill the voids of the mental scars of childhood and beyond. Fortunately, I found a better alternative during pre-university. Drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, tramadol, methadone and any other junk. My entrance exam rank was 2800. I was accepted into the field of industrial engineering at Noshirvani University of Babol. I was neither interested in my field nor in the university. I used to come to classes with pills. Little by little, I did not go to classes at all. And I used to do drugs in the dormitory all day. In this way, I met a few girls and broke up. None of them mattered. The first time I overdosed on pills in the dormitory. I overdosed three more times in different places.
Everything in life was like a piece of shit. Until I met the savior of my life, which is programming. 
I have a lot of knowledge but I am always ignored. And I will never have a decent income from programming. 
But still, he is my savior. Even when the love of my life, whose name was "Paniz". 
She left Me and left the biggest wound on my soul and it was programming that helped me.
I divided my existence into different parts and characters. illegible, interrupted girl,
uncle, MJ, Bamdad
and finally "Uncle Bamdad"
